How to use:

Do not edit in any file! Everything you can change you can found in the different setup files.
First and importants setup file is the SETUP.SQF <-- there you can find the most settings.
For a little bit more finetuning have a look in the SETUP_CLASSNAMES.SQF. Here you make further settings.
Some are important for the function of choosen options in the setup.sqf.
Third file is the SETUP_PUBLICVARIABLE.SQF --> in these file you have to define every publicVariable you want to use.
This file is executed only one time and only from the server.

If you want to start some custom files or make your own init commands you can do this in the INIT_CUSTOM.SQF.
This file will be executed from every machine one time like a normal init.sqf.

To update/change the vehicle pool you have to change the data files. You can found them here: dialogs\vehiclePool_war.hpp

VERY IMPORTANT: Before you start a test session or release the mission and you have made all your changes, it is
essential to open the mission folder and execute one time the SETUPCOPY.BAT file. (simple doubble klick on LMB)
If you change again anything on the setup files you have to repeat this step again.
